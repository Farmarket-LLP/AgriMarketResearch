Hi there!!!
Considering various problems in India, I researched on possible solutions where I got- 
1.	Farmers market where farmers get the price they want to. But the drawback is that there is no guarantee of selling all the produce/veggies that the farmer has brought in the market. Sometimes at the end of the day he might have to sell it at very low price. As he doesn’t afford to get it back to home and also farmers market opens only one day a week. Secondly, He has to work more in field to get better yield. If he is spending more time in market, then how he is going to give time to farming? 
2.	Community Supported agriculture (CSA)
3.	Online platform which make it easy to not only just sell farmers produce but also help them to get better price. FARMARKET: Get super smart deal/Direct to retail/ Direct to Consumer
<p>Direct to retail involves straight line produce transfer from farm to school, restaurants, hospitals, retailers, nursing home or to the food processing businesses. This form of marketing typically involves higher yields and can sometimes involve a co-operative system in which multiple farms collaborate of meet the demands of multiple institutions.
	As we proceed, in order to remove middlemen what we as FARMARKET going to do is taking responsibility of storage, packaging, transportation, distribution and advertising of the product to our platform. 
</p>
<p>At start, to make it simple to manage we gonna take just one product to serve and that one is TOMATO. Also gonna concentrate in limited region. We gonna make contract with tomato sauce company for providing them raw material of their choice (Tomato seed type etc.) till discussed date. The part of portion taken by middlemen in the market will be given to farmer and processor. At start we gonna take only processing cost of our service.
	
</p><p>
	We will also have an employee who will be an expert in how to avail the government schemes for farmers. Through which we could provide better protection to farmers along with our company protection like credit etc.

##For FARMARKET
	                 <p>By paying farmers a purchase price between an agreed-upon minimum and maximum, compa¬nies can provide farmers with a measure of pro¬tection against the price volatility that vexes the traditional horticulture market. 
	        	   </p><p>Firms should be aware of opportunities to design sourcing strategies that encourage the participation of women in supply chains. For example, employing female extension officers or buyers could be an appropriate and impactful way to involve more women farmers. 
transformation of agricultural marketing systems — One way companies increase traceability and create value is by reducing the number of inter¬mediaries in the supply chain and sourcing “direct” from farmers.</p>


#But who will benefit from this improved efficiency and value creation? How will the new food marketing systems impact food security and the world’s rural poor, especially small farmers, millions of whom depend on agriculture for their livelihoods—either as producers or laborers?
	New agricultural marketing systems with more direct sourcing could mean higher incomes for some farmers, more resources for farm investment in new technologies and assets, and a pathway out of poverty.

	Retail-led marketing systems not only reduce the number of middlemen between the “farm gate” and the consumer, but increase coordination and traceability—and value creation—creating a “value chain” instead of simply a “supply chain.”


Retail-led supply chains value reducing interme¬diaries and “buying direct” from farmers for six pri-mary reasons: 
	          a. lower overhead 
	          b. fewer delays 
	          c. better assurances of product safety and quality 
	          d. greater transparency and accountability in the supply chain 
	          e. better coordination with farmers 
	          f. enhanced public image 


Traditional supply chains 
		Farmers => Local Buyers => Regional Buyers => Wholesale market buyers => Retail Market => Consumer

Traditional supply chains in agriculture are relatively costly in the local economy, with heavy expenses for coordinating buyers and sellers, acquiring goods, and moving them around. 
The supply chains also result in indirect and haphazard relationships between the farmer at one end of the chain and retailers and consumers at the other. With little to no interaction between them, com¬munication about production practices and product variety and quality is limited.

	
Retail-led supply chain
Farmers => Intermediary (NGO, private company, or farmers' organization) =>  Super market/ Food processor

<p>Farmers can benefit in a range of ways from partic¬ipation in new retail-led supply chains, including through lower transaction and transport costs and agreements that reduce market price volatility (rel¬ative to the traditional market). 
</p><p>In China, Walmart China relies on a group of important new actors— third-party Chinese supplier companies. These companies either source from small farmers through contracts or employ small farmers on supply company farms or through supply company sub¬leases of aggregated land.
</p><p>These new, well-capitalized and geographically diversified intermediary compa¬nies handle logistics and supply chain management for Walmart, including relationships with farmers.
</p><p>Private, well-capitalized supply companies play imp role in China, some of their roles are similar—coordi-nating production schedules and varieties with farm¬ers, sorting for quality and private label standards, and selling products that do not meet standards into the traditional market system.
</p>
<p>The downsides for companies sourcing from small farmers are cost and risk. Small-farmer sourcing can be relatively expensive if a buyer has to pay the costs of the transaction (negotiating the quantity, quality, and price; setting up the logistics of purchasing and payment). 
</p><p>In addition, small farmers may not have the capital or production scale to consistently reach con¬tracted quantities or quality standards that food com¬panies require. 
</p><p>Additional costs for buyers include the overhead of establishing and managing a sourcing system and confirming and maintaining relationships with numerous small farmers. This supplier cost-risk tradeoff is a persistent tension in the transformation of agricultural supply chains in the developing world.
